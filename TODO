TODO list:
----------

- MODE STREAM (it means several commands at the same time without waiting for responses)
- Check more the patterns of searching (wildmat) -> backend.format_wildcards() -> Work in progress
- Show banner on the footer of the articles about the site
- Implement some sort of timeout mechanism (According to the new NNTP protocol timeouts should not be explained [i.e. no responses])
- Add INSTALL and all of the other crap
